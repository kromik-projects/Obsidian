## Why Pronunciation Matters

French pronunciation is **very different** from English. The good news: French pronunciation is actually more consistent than English. Once you learn the rules, you can pronounce almost any word correctly just by looking at it. English is the weird one where "cough," "through," and "dough" all sound different.

## The French Alphabet

French uses the same 26 letters as English, but they sound different when you say them:

| Letter | French Name | Sounds Like |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| A | ah | "ah" as in "father" |
| B | beh | "bay" |
| C | seh | "say" |
| D | deh | "day" |
| E | euh | a soft "uh" (no English equivalent - round your lips slightly) |
| F | eff | "eff" |
| G | zheh | "zhay" (like the "s" in "pleasure") |
| H | ahsh | "ahsh" (the H is always silent in French words!) |
| I | ee | "ee" as in "see" |
| J | zhee | "zhee" (like "s" in "measure" + "ee") |
| K | kah | "kah" |
| L | ell | "ell" |
| M | emm | "emm" |
| N | enn | "enn" |
| O | oh | "oh" |
| P | peh | "pay" |
| Q | kew | "kew" |
| R | air | "air" (but with a throaty/gargling R sound) |
| S | ess | "ess" |
| T | teh | "tay" |
| U | ew | "ew" (purse your lips like kissing and say "ee") |
| V | veh | "vay" |
| W | doobluh-veh | "doo-bluh-vay" |
| X | eeks | "eeks" |
| Y | ee-grek | "ee-grek" |
| Z | zed | "zed" |

## The 5 Special Accent Marks

French uses accent marks that change how letters are pronounced:

### 1. L'accent aigu (ay-gew) - only on E
- **e** = **eh/uh** but **e** with accent = **ay**
- Example: **cafe** is written **cafe** but **resume** is written **resume**

| Symbol | Name | Example | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| e | accent aigu | ete | summer |

### 2. L'accent grave (ahk-sahn grahv) - on E, A, U
- Makes **e** sound like "eh" (as in "bed")

| Symbol | Name | Example | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| e (with grave) | accent grave | pere | father |
| a (with grave) | accent grave | la | there |

### 3. L'accent circonflexe (seer-kohn-flex) - the little hat ^
- Sits on top of vowels: a, e, i, o, u
- Example: **hotel** (oh-tell), **foret** (forest)

### 4. La cedille (say-dee-yuh) - the little tail under C
- Makes **C** soft (like "s") before A, O, U
- Example: **francais** (frahn-say) = French
- Without it, **ca** would sound like "ka"

### 5. Le trema (tray-mah) - two dots over a vowel
- Means "pronounce this vowel separately"
- Example: **Noel** (noh-ell, two syllables, not "nole")

## The Key French Sounds

These are the sounds that do NOT exist in English. Master these and you will sound much more natural:

### The French R
- **Not** like the English R at all
- It comes from the **back of your throat**, almost like a gentle gargle
- Practice: try saying "ruh" while gargling lightly
- Words to practice: **rouge** (roozh - red), **rue** (rew - street), **Paris** (pah-ree)

### The French U
- Say "ee" (like "see")
- Now keep your tongue in that position but **round your lips** like you are about to whistle
- That is the French U sound
- Words to practice: **tu** (tew - you), **rue** (rew - street), **lune** (lewn - moon)

### The Nasal Vowels
French has vowels that go **through your nose**. There is nothing like this in English.

| Spelling | Sound | Example | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|
| an / en | "ahn" (nasal) | **blanc** (blahn) | white |
| on | "ohn" (nasal) | **bon** (bohn) | good |
| in / ain / ein | "an" (nasal, like "pan" but nasal) | **vin** (van) | wine |
| un | "uhn" (nasal) | **un** (uhn) | one |

> [!tip] How to make nasal sounds
> Say the vowel sound normally, then try to redirect the air through your nose instead of your mouth. Your mouth stays open but the sound buzzes in your nose. Pinch your nose while practicing - if the sound changes, you are doing it right!

## Essential Pronunciation Rules

### Silent Letters
French has MANY silent letters. Here are the rules:

1. **Final consonants are usually silent**: the last letter is often not pronounced
   - **petit** (puh-tee) - the T is silent
   - **chat** (shah) - the T is silent
   - **deux** (duh) - the X is silent

2. **Exception - C, R, F, L are often pronounced** (remember: "CaReFuL")
   - **avec** (ah-vek) - C is pronounced
   - **bonjour** (bohn-zhoor) - R is pronounced
   - **neuf** (nuhf) - F is pronounced
   - **hotel** (oh-tel) - L is pronounced

3. **H is ALWAYS silent**
   - **homme** (ohm) = man
   - **hotel** (oh-tel) = hotel

4. **Final E is usually silent**
   - **table** (tahbl) - the E is silent
   - **femme** (fahm) - the E is silent

### Liaison - Linking Words Together
When a word ending in a silent consonant is followed by a word starting with a vowel, the consonant "comes alive" and links to the next word:

- **les amis** (lay-zah-mee) = the friends (the S links to "amis")
- **vous avez** (voo-zah-vay) = you have (the S links to "avez")
- **un ami** (uh-nah-mee) = a friend (the N links to "ami")

## Common Letter Combinations

| Spelling | Pronunciation | Example |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| ou | "oo" | **vous** (voo) = you |
| oi | "wah" | **moi** (mwah) = me |
| au / eau | "oh" | **beau** (boh) = beautiful |
| ai / ei | "eh" | **fait** (feh) = done |
| eu / oeu | "uh" (rounded lips) | **deux** (duh) = two |
| ch | "sh" | **chat** (shah) = cat |
| gn | "ny" (like canyon) | **montagne** (mohn-tahn-yuh) = mountain |
| qu | "k" | **qui** (kee) = who |
| th | "t" (no "th" sound!) | **the** (tay) = tea |
| ph | "f" | **photo** (foh-toh) = photo |
| tion | "see-ohn" | **nation** (nah-see-ohn) = nation |
| ille | "ee-yuh" | **fille** (fee-yuh) = girl |
