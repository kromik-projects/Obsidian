## Formal vs. Informal: The Big Rule

Before we learn anything else, you need to understand the most important social rule in French:

> [!warning] Tu vs. Vous
> French has **two words for "you"**:
> - **Tu** (tew) = informal "you" - for friends, family, children, people your age, your girlfriend
> - **Vous** (voo) = formal "you" - for strangers, older people, bosses, showing respect
>
> Using **tu** with someone you should use **vous** with is considered rude. When in doubt, use **vous**. The other person will tell you "on peut se tutoyer" (we can use tu) if they want to switch.

With your girlfriend: always **tu**.
With her parents (first time meeting): **vous** until they say otherwise.

**Informal (with tu):**
