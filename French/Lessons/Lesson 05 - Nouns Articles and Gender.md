## The Big Concept: Everything Has a Gender

In French, **every single noun** is either **masculine** or **feminine**. This is not optional - it is built into the language.

- **le soleil** (the sun) = masculine
- **la lune** (the moon) = feminine
- **le livre** (the book) = masculine
- **la table** (the table) = feminine

> [!warning] There is No Logic to This
> Gender is often arbitrary. A table is feminine but a desk (le bureau) is masculine. You simply have to learn the gender with each new word. **Always learn nouns with their article** (le/la), never alone.
>
> When you learn "book," don't memorize "livre." Memorize "**le** livre."

## Definite Articles: "The"

In English, "the" is always just "the." In French, it changes based on gender and number:

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|----------|--------|
| **Masculine** | **le** (luh) | **les** (lay) |
| **Feminine** | **la** (lah) | **les** (lay) |
| **Before a vowel** | **l'** | **les** (lay) |

Examples:
- **le garcon** = the boy
- **la fille** = the girl
- **l'homme** = the man (masculine, but starts with vowel sound)
- **l'eau** = the water (feminine, but starts with vowel sound)
- **les garcons** = the boys
- **les filles** = the girls

> [!note] Important
> When a noun starts with a vowel or silent H, both **le** and **la** become **l'**. You cannot tell the gender from **l'** alone - you have to learn it.

## Indefinite Articles: "A / An / Some"

| | Singular | Plural |
|---|----------|--------|
| **Masculine** | **un** (uhn) | **des** (day) |
| **Feminine** | **une** (ewn) | **des** (day) |

Examples:
- **un livre** = a book
- **une maison** = a house
- **des livres** = some books / books
- **des maisons** = some houses / houses

> [!tip] "Des" = The Invisible English Word
> French requires **des** where English uses nothing. In English you say "I have books." In French: "J'ai **des** livres." You cannot just say "J'ai livres" - that sounds as wrong as "I have the" without a noun in English.

## How to Guess the Gender

While you should always learn the gender with the word, there are patterns that are right about 80% of the time:

### Usually Masculine

| Ending | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| -age | le fromage | cheese |
| -ment | le moment | moment |
| -eau | le gateau | cake |
| -isme | le tourisme | tourism |
| -phone | le telephone | telephone |

### Usually Feminine

| Ending | Example | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| -tion / -sion | la nation | nation |
| -te | la liberte | liberty |
| -ure | la voiture | car |
| -ence / -ance | la difference | difference |
| -ie | la boulangerie | bakery |
| -ette | la fourchette | fork |

> [!warning] These Are Tendencies, Not Rules
> There are exceptions. **La plage** (the beach) ends in -age but is feminine. Always check when you learn a new word.

## Making Things Plural

### The Basic Rule: Add -S

Just like English, the most common way to make a French noun plural is to add **-s**:

- le chat -> les chat**s** (cats)
- la maison -> les maison**s** (houses)

> [!important] The S is Silent!
> Unlike English, the plural -s is **not pronounced** in French. "Chat" and "chats" sound exactly the same. The article (les vs. le/la) is what tells you it is plural.

### Special Plural Rules

| Singular Ending | Plural Ending | Example |
|----------------|---------------|---------|
| -s, -x, -z | no change | le fils -> les fils (sons) |
| -eau | -eaux | le gateau -> les gateaux (cakes) |
| -al | -aux | le journal -> les journaux (newspapers) |
| -ou | -ous (usually) | le trou -> les trous (holes) |

---

## Partitive Articles: "Some / Any"

When talking about an unspecified quantity (some water, some bread), French uses **partitive articles**:

| | Form | Example |
|---|------|---------|
| **Masculine** | **du** (dew) | du pain = some bread |
| **Feminine** | **de la** (duh lah) | de la musique = some music |
| **Before vowel** | **de l'** (duh l) | de l'eau = some water |
| **Plural** | **des** (day) | des fruits = some fruits |

Examples in sentences:
- **Je veux du cafe.** = I want (some) coffee.
- **Tu veux de la soupe ?** = Do you want (some) soup?
- **Il y a de l'eau.** = There is (some) water.
- **J'achete des pommes.** = I'm buying (some) apples.

> [!tip] In Negative Sentences, Everything Becomes "de"
> When you say you **don't** want something, du/de la/des all become just **de** (or **d'** before a vowel):
> - Je veux **du** pain. -> Je ne veux pas **de** pain.
> - J'ai **des** amis. -> Je n'ai pas **d'**amis.
