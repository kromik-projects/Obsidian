## Three Ways to Ask Yes/No Questions

French gives you three different ways to turn a statement into a question. They range from casual to formal.

Let's take the statement: **Tu parles francais.** (You speak French.)

### Method 1: Just Raise Your Voice (Casual)

Simply say the statement with a rising tone at the end, like in English:

> **Tu parles francais ?** (rising intonation)
> *You speak French?*

This is the **most common** method in everyday spoken French.

### Method 2: Add "Est-ce que" at the Beginning (Standard)

Put **est-ce que** (ess kuh) at the start of any statement:

> **Est-ce que tu parles francais ?**
> *Do you speak French?*

This works in any situation - casual or formal. It is the safest choice for a beginner.

### Method 3: Inversion - Flip the Subject and Verb (Formal)

Swap the pronoun and verb, connect them with a hyphen:

> **Parles-tu francais ?**
> *Do you speak French?*

This sounds more formal/literary. You will see it in writing and hear it in polite contexts.

> [!tip] Beginner Recommendation
> Use **Method 1** (intonation) with friends and your girlfriend.
> Use **Method 2** (est-ce que) everywhere else.
> Understand **Method 3** (inversion) when you hear it, but you don't need to use it yet.

## Asking "What?" - The Different Ways

"What" in French has several forms depending on how it is used:

### Qu'est-ce que...? (What...? - as the object)
- **Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?** = What are you doing?
- **Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?** = What do you want?
- **Qu'est-ce que c'est ?** = What is this/that?

### Qu'est-ce qui...? (What...? - as the subject)
- **Qu'est-ce qui se passe ?** = What's happening?
- **Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas ?** = What's wrong?

### Quoi? (What? - casual / end of sentence)
- **Tu fais quoi ?** = What are you doing? (casual)
- **C'est quoi ?** = What's that? (casual)
- **Quoi ?** = What? / Huh? (very casual)

> [!tip] For Everyday Use
> In casual speech, you will hear **quoi** at the end of sentences much more than the formal constructions:
> - **Tu veux quoi ?** = What do you want?
> - **Tu regardes quoi ?** = What are you watching?
> - **On mange quoi ?** = What are we eating?
