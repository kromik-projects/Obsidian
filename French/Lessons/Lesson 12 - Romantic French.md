## Terms of Endearment

These are the French equivalents of "babe," "honey," "sweetheart," etc. French people use these constantly with their partners.

### The Most Common

| French | Pronunciation | Literal Meaning | Used Like |
|--------|--------------|----------------|-----------|
| mon amour | mohn ah-moor | my love | honey / my love |
| mon coeur | mohn kuhr | my heart | sweetheart |
| ma cherie | mah shay-ree | my dear (to a woman) | darling |
| mon bebe | mohn bay-bay | my baby | baby/babe |
| ma belle | mah bell | my beautiful | beautiful |
| ma puce | mah pewss | my flea | sweetie (yes, really!) |
| mon tresor | mohn tray-zohr | my treasure | my treasure |
| ma vie | mah vee | my life | my everything |

> [!tip] "Mon" with Feminine Words?
> You might notice **mon** amour, **mon** coeur - even though "amour" and "coeur" could apply to a woman. In terms of endearment, some words always use **mon** regardless of the partner's gender. This is normal.

### Cute / Playful

| French | Meaning | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| mon chou | my cabbage / my cream puff | Very common and affectionate |
| ma biche | my doe | Sweet and gentle |
| mon ange | my angel | Romantic |
| mon lapin | my rabbit | Playful |
| mon nounours | my teddy bear | Cute |
| ma princesse | my princess | Romantic |
| mon petit coeur | my little heart | Very sweet |
| ma douce | my sweet one | Tender |

> [!note] These Sound Strange Translated
> Yes, "my flea" and "my cabbage" sound weird in English. In French, they are completely normal and very sweet. Your girlfriend will love hearing them.

## Saying "I Love You"

### The Big Ones

| French | Pronunciation | Meaning | Intensity |
|--------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| Je t'aime | zhuh tem | I love you | The real deal - serious love |
| Je t'adore | zhuh tah-dohr | I adore you | Very strong |
| Je t'aime bien | zhuh tem bee-en | I like you | Careful! This is LESS strong than "je t'aime" |
| Je t'aime beaucoup | zhuh tem boh-koo | I love you very much | Strong |
| Je t'aime de tout mon coeur | zhuh tem duh too mohn kuhr | I love you with all my heart | Very romantic |
| Je suis fou de toi | zhuh swee foo duh twah | I'm crazy about you | Passionate (male speaker) |
| Je suis folle de toi | zhuh swee fohl duh twah | I'm crazy about you | Passionate (female speaker) |

> [!warning] "Je t'aime" vs "Je t'aime bien"
> This is a famous trap:
> - **Je t'aime** = I love you (romantic)
> - **Je t'aime bien** = I like you (friendly, NOT romantic)
>
> Adding "bien" actually **weakens** the phrase! "Je t'aime bien" is what you say to a friend you like. Never say this to your girlfriend thinking it means "I love you a lot." For that, say **"Je t'aime tellement"** (I love you so much) or **"Je t'aime beaucoup."**
