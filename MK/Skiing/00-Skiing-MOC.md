## Your Current Level

With ~2 weeks of skiing experience, you likely:
- Can do basic snowplow (pizza/wedge) stops
- Have attempted some parallel skiing
- Feel comfortable on green runs
- Are starting to explore blue runs
- May still feel unstable at higher speeds

**Goal:** Build confidence, refine technique, and progress to skiing any terrain with control and style.

## Key Principles to Remember

### 1. Patience Over Speed
Don't rush to harder terrain. Master each skill level before progressing.

### 2. Quality Over Quantity
10 focused runs beat 30 sloppy ones. Take breaks to reset mentally.

### 3. Lessons Are Worth It
Even 1-2 professional lessons can fix months of bad habits.

### 4. Terrain Matches Skill Practice
- Learning new technique → Easy terrain
- Building confidence → Current level terrain
- Testing limits → Slightly harder terrain
