# Stance and Balance - The Foundation

Your stance is the single most important element in skiing. Every technique builds on this foundation. A poor stance makes everything harder; a good stance makes improvement natural.

    - Slight forward lean         - Standing too upright
    - Knees bent                  - Legs straight
    - Hands forward               - Arms at sides
    - Weight on balls of feet     - Weight on heels
```

### The Checklist (Bottom to Top)

#### 1. FEET
- **Width:** Hip-width apart (shoulder-width max)
- **Weight:** 60% on balls of feet, 40% on heels
- **Pressure:** Feel shins pressing lightly against boot tongue
- **Equal weight:** 50/50 on each foot when going straight

```
FOOT PRESSURE MAP:

    ┌─────────────┐
    │  ●●●●●●●●   │  ← Toes: Light contact
    │  ████████   │  ← Ball: PRIMARY weight (60%)
    │  ████████   │
    │    ████     │  ← Arch: Support
    │    ████     │
    │   ██████    │  ← Heel: Secondary weight (40%)
    └─────────────┘
```

#### 2. ANKLES
- **Flexed forward** - Shins pressing into boot tongues
- Imagine you're about to jump
- This is called "ankle flexion" or "forward pressure"

**Test:** Can you wiggle your toes? You should be able to. If not, too much pressure.

#### 3. KNEES
- **Bent** at roughly 15-20 degrees
- Knees should be over toes (not behind)
- Soft and ready to absorb terrain
- Never locked straight!

    (GOOD)             (sitting back)       (over-flexed)
```

#### 4. HIPS
- **Centered** over feet
- Slight forward tilt of pelvis
- Not sitting back like in a chair!

**Common mistake:** "Sitting in the back seat" - hips behind feet

#### 5. TORSO
- **Slight forward lean** from ankles (not waist)
- Chest faces downhill
- Core engaged (like bracing for a punch)
- Shoulders relaxed, not tense

#### 6. ARMS & HANDS
- **Hands forward** and visible in peripheral vision
- Elbows slightly bent, away from body
- Hold poles with tips pointing backward and down
- Hands at about hip to belly-button height

```

              ●
           (skier)
```

#### 7. HEAD & EYES
- **Look where you want to go** (not at your skis!)
- Head up, chin level
- Eyes scanning 10-20 meters ahead

## The "Ready Position" Feeling

Imagine these scenarios to feel the correct stance:

### 1. The Basketball Defense Stance
Stand like you're guarding someone in basketball - knees bent, hands ready, weight forward on balls of feet, ready to move any direction.

### 2. The Gorilla Pose
Slight bend at hips, arms hanging forward with hands in front of you - that's roughly where your hands should be.

### 3. About to Jump
If someone said "jump NOW" - that ready, athletic crouch is close to your ski stance.

## Weight Distribution Scenarios

### Going Straight (Schussing)
```
Left Ski    Right Ski
   50%   ═══   50%
```

### Turning Left
```
Left Ski    Right Ski
   30%   ═══   70%      (Weight shifts to outside/right ski)
```

### Turning Right
```
Left Ski    Right Ski
   70%   ═══   30%      (Weight shifts to outside/left ski)
```

## Common Stance Mistakes

### 1. "The Backseat" ❌
**Problem:** Weight on heels, hips behind feet
**Looks like:** Sitting in an invisible chair
**Why it's bad:** Skis become uncontrollable, legs tire fast
**Fix:** Push shins into boots, hands forward

```

──●──●──              ──●──●──
  Hips back             Hips centered
```

### 2. "The Stiff Soldier" ❌
**Problem:** Legs locked straight
**Why it's bad:** Can't absorb bumps, no edge control
**Fix:** Bounce gently while skiing to stay loose

### 3. "The T-Rex Arms" ❌
**Problem:** Arms tucked close to body
**Why it's bad:** Poor balance, can't use poles effectively
**Fix:** Pretend you're carrying a big beach ball

### 4. "The Looky-Loo" ❌
**Problem:** Staring at ski tips
**Why it's bad:** Throws off balance, can't see terrain/people
**Fix:** Pick a target ahead and ski toward it

### 5. "The Lean Back in Fear" ❌
**Problem:** Steeper terrain → lean uphill
**Why it's bad:** Actually makes you MORE likely to fall
**Fix:** Trust the stance - lean INTO the hill, not away

## Drills to Practice Stance

### Drill 1: Shin Pressure Check
While standing still, lift your heels slightly. Can you feel pressure on your shins? That's the forward pressure you want.

### Drill 2: Hands in Vision
Ski with your hands where you can always see them in your peripheral vision. If they disappear, bring them forward.

### Drill 3: One-Ski Balance
On a gentle slope, lift one ski slightly off the snow while gliding. This forces proper balance over the weighted ski.

### Drill 4: Bouncing
While skiing slowly, bounce gently up and down. This keeps your legs soft and athletic, not locked.

### Drill 5: The Boxer
Ski with fists up like a boxer's guard. This automatically puts your hands in the right forward position.

## Daily Stance Reminder

Before each run, do this 5-second check:

1. ✅ Shins touching boot tongues
2. ✅ Knees soft and bent
3. ✅ Hands visible in front
4. ✅ Looking ahead, not down
5. ✅ Core engaged, ready to move

---

## Key Takeaway

> "When in doubt, get more forward."

90% of beginner problems come from being too far back. If something feels wrong, the answer is almost always: **more forward pressure, more knee bend, hands more forward.**
