# Snowplow Mastery - Your Speed Control Foundation

The snowplow (also called "pizza" or "wedge") is not just for beginners - it's a fundamental skill that even experts use. Master it completely before rushing to parallel skiing.

## What is the Snowplow?

The snowplow position creates friction by angling your ski tips together while pushing the tails apart, forming a "V" or pizza slice shape.

```

          ╱       ╲
```

## The Snowplow Stop

### Step-by-Step

1. **Start in athletic stance** on gentle slope
2. **Push heels outward** while keeping tips together
3. **Roll ankles inward** (knees come slightly together)
4. **Apply equal pressure** to both inside edges
5. **Increase wedge size** to slow more
6. **Maintain forward stance** - don't lean back!

### Visual: Edge Engagement

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Tips crossing | Skis collide, fall | Keep fist-width gap at tips |
| Leaning back | Skis shoot forward | Press shins into boots |
| Uneven pressure | Turn instead of stop | Focus on equal push both legs |
| Stiff legs | No control | Stay bouncy, knees soft |

## The Wedge Turn

The wedge turn is how you'll navigate slopes before parallel skiing.

### Turning LEFT (Right ski dominant)

```
Phase 1: INITIATE          Phase 2: TURN           Phase 3: COMPLETE

      ↑                         ↖                        ←
     ╲ ╱                       ╲ ╱                      ╲ ╱
      V                         V                        V
     / \                       /█\                      / \
    /   \                     / █ \                    /   \
                             ▲
Equal weight              MORE WEIGHT              Return to equal
                         on RIGHT ski
```

### How to Execute

1. **Start in wedge** going straight
2. **Shift weight to OUTSIDE ski** (turning left = weight on right ski)
3. **Press that ski's edge** into the snow more
4. **Guide with knees** - point them where you want to go
5. **Let the ski do the work** - it's designed to turn!
6. **Complete turn**, return to balanced wedge

### The Key Insight

> **To turn LEFT → Weight the RIGHT ski**
> **To turn RIGHT → Weight the LEFT ski**

The outside ski (relative to turn direction) is always your dominant ski.

### Why Does Weighting One Ski Make You Turn?

```

         ╲═════════════╱    Weighted ski has more
          ╲           ╱     edge grip → creates

```

The edged ski acts like a curved rail - when you weight it, you follow that curve.

## Progressive Wedge Drills

### Drill 1: Wedge Width Control

Practice making your wedge **bigger** and **smaller** while moving:

```
Narrow wedge     Medium wedge      Wide wedge
(faster)         (moderate)        (slower/stop)

    \  /             \   /            \     /
     \/               \ /              \   /
     /\               / \              /   /
    /  \             /   \            /     \
```

### Drill 2: Gliding Wedge
Maintain a small wedge without pushing - just glide and feel the control.

### Drill 3: Wedge-Straight-Wedge
Alternate between:
- Wedge (slow down)
- Parallel/straight (speed up)
- Wedge (slow down)

This builds edge pressure awareness.

### Drill 4: One-Ski Wedge Pressure
In a wedge, shift ALL weight to one ski, then the other. Feel how this creates turns.

### Drill 5: Falling Leaf
Traverse slope in a wedge, then turn uphill to stop. Repeat going other direction. Like a leaf falling back and forth.

```
START →    ↘
              ↘
                → STOP, turn uphill
              ↙
            ↙
STOP ←   ↙
            ↘
              ↘
                → (repeat pattern)
```

## Linking Wedge Turns

### The Goal
Smooth, connected turns down a green slope with complete control.

### The Rhythm
```
Turn    Transition    Turn    Transition    Turn
Left    (flatten)    Right    (flatten)    Left

 ↓         ↓          ↓         ↓          ↓
 ↙    →    ↓    →     ↘    →    ↓    →     ↙
```

### Step-by-Step

1. **Complete turn 1** (e.g., turning left)
2. **Briefly flatten** both skis (equal weight)
3. **Transfer weight** to new outside ski
4. **Begin turn 2** (now turning right)
5. **Repeat** - continuous S-curves down the slope

### What It Should Feel Like

- **Smooth**, not jerky
- **Rhythmic**, like a dance
- **Controlled**, you choose the speed
- **Confident**, no panic stops needed

## Terrain Progression

### Where to Practice

| Stage | Terrain | Goal |
|-------|---------|------|
| 1 | Bunny slope / Magic carpet | Basic wedge stop |
| 2 | Gentle green | Wedge turns both directions |
| 3 | Longer green | Linked turns, rhythm |
| 4 | Steeper green / Easy blue | Speed control with wedge |

---

## Signs You're Ready to Progress

✅ Can stop confidently anywhere on green runs
✅ Can make wedge turns in both directions
✅ Can link 5+ turns smoothly
✅ Don't feel panicked when you pick up speed
✅ Can vary turn size (short radius, long radius)
✅ Can ski a full green run without stopping

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My skis keep crossing!"
- Keep a fist-width gap between tips
- Reduce wedge width (you're pushing too hard)
- Check boot fit (might be too loose)

### "I can only turn one direction!"
- Practice the weak side more
- Focus on weighting that outside ski
- Turn your shoulders to face turn direction

### "I'm going too fast!"
- Make wedge wider
- Start on gentler terrain
- Finish turns more across the slope (not down)

### "My legs burn!"
- Wedge is tiring - that's normal!
- Take breaks between runs
- Make sure you're not "squeezing" muscles unnecessarily

## Key Takeaway

> **The wedge is your emergency brake. Never progress beyond terrain where your wedge can stop you.**

If you can't wedge-stop confidently on a slope, you're not ready for that slope yet.
