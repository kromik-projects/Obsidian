# Basic Turning - Wedge to Stem Christie

This is the bridge between snowplow and parallel skiing. The stem christie combines wedge initiation with a parallel finish.

## The Stem Christie Explained

"Stem" = pushing one ski out into a wedge
"Christie" = bringing skis parallel

### The Move: Start in Wedge, Finish Parallel

```
PHASE 1: INITIATE (Wedge)          PHASE 2: TURN (Transition)

        ↓                                  ↙
       ╲ ╱                               ╲  ╱
        V                                 ╲╱
       / \                                ||
      /   \                               ||

Weight outside ski,                 Begin bringing inside
start turn with wedge               ski parallel


PHASE 3: COMPLETE (Parallel)

        ←
       ||
       ||
       ╱╲

       Skis parallel,
       finish turn across slope
```

## Step-by-Step Stem Christie

### Turning Left

1. **Traverse** or glide with skis relatively parallel
2. **Stem out** the right ski (push tail out, creating a wedge)
3. **Weight the right ski** (the stemmed ski becomes your turning ski)
4. **Begin the turn** - you'll start curving left
5. **Match the skis** - bring left ski parallel to right ski
6. **Complete turn** with both skis parallel, crossing the fall line
7. **Edge and stop** or begin next turn

## The "Match" - Most Important Part

The moment you bring the inside ski parallel to the outside ski is called the "match." This is the skill that transitions you from wedge to parallel.

### Timing the Match

| Match Timing | Result | When to Use |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| Late (after turn) | Safer, more control | Learning, steeper terrain |
| Middle (during turn) | Balanced | Most situations |
| Early (start of turn) | More dynamic | As skill improves |

### Practicing the Match

**Drill: Exaggerated Match**
1. Start in wedge
2. Begin turn
3. **Loudly/actively bring inside ski in** (make it obvious)
4. Feel the skis come parallel
5. Repeat other direction

## Common Stem Christie Mistakes

### 1. Forgetting to Weight the Outside Ski

**Problem:** Turn feels weak, skis don't respond
**Feel:** Like you're just twisting, not turning

**Fix:** Really commit weight to the stemmed (outside) ski. You should feel 70-80% of weight there.

### 2. Never Actually Matching

**Problem:** Staying in wedge through entire turn
**Feel:** Legs get tired, turns feel effortful

**Fix:** Consciously pull that inside ski in. Say "match!" out loud as you do it.

### 3. Matching Too Early (Before the Fall Line)

**Problem:** Losing control, speeding up
**Feel:** Scary, out of control

**Fix:** Be patient. Keep the wedge until you're past the fall line, then match.

```
THE FALL LINE:

           ▲ UP
           │
    ←──────┼──────→  Fall Line
           │         (Steepest direction)
           ▼ DOWN

Match your skis AFTER crossing the fall line
(when you're starting to turn uphill)
```

### 4. Upper Body Rotation

**Problem:** Shoulders twisting into turn
**Feel:** Awkward, off-balance

**Fix:** Keep chest facing downhill. Turn with legs, not torso.

## Turn Shape Control

### Controlling Your Speed Through Turn Shape

The more you turn across the hill, the slower you go.
The more you point downhill, the faster you go.

```
SPEED CONTROL VIA TURN SHAPE:

    START                              START
      │                                  │
      ↓                                  ↓
     ╱                                    \
    ╱                                      \
   ╱    "Turning across           "Pointing   \
  ╱      the slope" =              downhill" = \
 →       SLOWER                    FASTER       →
         MORE CONTROL              LESS CONTROL
```

### Making Round Turns

Round turns = Control
Straight runs between turns = Speed (danger)

```
GOOD (Rounded):          BAD (Z-shaped):

   ╭───╮                    /
   │   │                   /
   │   ╰──╮               /
   │      │              /
   ╰──╮   │              \
      │   │               \
      ╰───╯                \
```

## Drills for Stem Christie

### Drill 1: Stem-Match Garland

On a gentle slope:
1. Traverse across
2. Stem the downhill ski briefly
3. Match back to parallel
4. Repeat without actually completing a full turn

This isolates the stem-match feeling.

### Drill 2: Hockey Stop Practice

From a slow traverse, try to stop with both skis parallel (hockey stop style). This builds matching skills.

### Drill 3: One Turn, Then Stop

Make ONE stem christie turn, then stop completely in a parallel position. Reset and repeat. Quality over quantity.

### Drill 4: Counting

Count "1-2-3-MATCH" during each turn:
- 1 = Stem out
- 2 = Weight outside ski
- 3 = Begin turn
- MATCH = Bring skis parallel

### Drill 5: Follow the Leader

Ski behind a more experienced skier, trying to match their turn shape and timing.

## Terrain Recommendations

| Skill Stage | Terrain | Goal |
|-------------|---------|------|
| First attempts | Easy green | Feel the stem-match sequence |
| Building consistency | Moderate green | Link 5+ stem christies |
| Gaining confidence | Long green/easy blue | Full run of stem christies |
| Refining | Blue runs | Smooth, controlled stem christies |

---

## Signs You're Ready for Full Parallel

✅ Stem christie is comfortable on blue runs
✅ You can match your skis smoothly
✅ You sometimes accidentally do parallel turns
✅ The wedge initiation feels unnecessary
✅ You want to go faster with more control
✅ Turns feel rhythmic and connected

## Key Takeaway

> **The stem christie is training wheels for parallel skiing. Don't skip it!**

This intermediate step builds the muscle memory for weight transfer and ski matching that makes parallel skiing natural.
