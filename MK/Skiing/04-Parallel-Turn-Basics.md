# Parallel Turn Basics - Both Skis Together

The parallel turn is when skiing starts to feel like "real" skiing. Both skis stay parallel throughout the entire turn. This is your goal!

## What Makes a Turn "Parallel"?

```
WEDGE TURN:                    PARALLEL TURN:

      ↓                              ↓
     ╲ ╱                            ||
      V                             ||
     / \                            ||
    /   \                          ╱╲
   ↙                              ↙

Skis form a V                 Skis stay parallel
                              throughout turn
```

In a parallel turn:
- Skis remain hip-width apart
- Both skis tip onto edges simultaneously
- Both skis arc through the turn together
- No wedge needed at any point

## The Parallel Turn Mechanics

### The Sequence

```
PHASE 1: EDGE CHANGE          PHASE 2: FALL LINE          PHASE 3: FINISH

        ↓                            ↙                          ←
       ||                           ||                         ||
       ||                           ╱╲                         ||
      ╱  ╲                                                    ╲  ╱
   Flatten skis,              Skis arc through            Complete turn,
   shift weight               the turn                    prepare for next
```

### The Four Key Moments

1. **Initiation** - Start the turn by flattening skis and shifting weight
2. **Fall Line** - Skis point downhill, maximum speed moment
3. **Apex** - Maximum edge angle, skis carving through turn
4. **Completion** - Turn finishes, prepare for next turn

## How to Make a Parallel Turn

### Step-by-Step (Turning Left)

1. **Start in athletic stance**, skis parallel, traversing or pointing slightly downhill

2. **Extend/rise slightly** - This lightens the skis and releases the edges

3. **Flatten your skis** - Roll ankles from current edges to flat

4. **Transfer weight to right (outside) ski** - Feel pressure on that foot

5. **Roll both ankles left** - This tips both skis onto their left edges

6. **Point knees into the turn** - Knees face where you want to go

7. **Let skis arc** - The sidecut of the ski creates the turn

8. **Control radius** - More edge angle = tighter turn

9. **Finish across the slope** - Bleed speed by completing turn

10. **Prepare for next turn** - Repeat on other side

---

## The Magic: Edge Angles

Your skis are designed to turn when tipped on edge. This is called the **sidecut**.

```
SKI SIDECUT (View from above):

Tail ═══════════════════════════════ Tip
              ╲              ╱
               ╲            ╱     The ski's waist is
                ╲__________╱      narrower than tip/tail

When tilted on edge, this shape carves an arc!
```

### Edge Angle = Turn Radius

```
FLAT SKI:                    EDGED SKI:

    ▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔                    ╱
    ════════                   ╱
    ▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁                  ╱

Goes straight              Carves a turn
```

| Edge Angle | Turn Radius | Use Case |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Small (5-15°) | Large radius | Long, sweeping turns |
| Medium (15-30°) | Medium radius | Standard turns |
| Large (30-45°+) | Small radius | Short, quick turns |

---

## Weight Distribution in Parallel

### Throughout the Turn

```
START:         TURN:          FINISH:
50/50         30/70          40/60
  │             │              │
  ▼             ▼              ▼
══════       ══════         ══════
Left Right   Left Right    Left Right

Even →     Weight outside →  Even-ish
           (inside of turn)
```

### The Outside Ski is Key

**60-80% of your weight should be on the OUTSIDE ski** (the ski on the outside of the turn arc).

Turning left? Right ski is outside → Weight right ski.
Turning right? Left ski is outside → Weight left ski.

## Upper Body Position

### The Quiet Upper Body

Your legs do the turning. Your upper body stays relatively quiet and stable.

```
GOOD:                           BAD:

        ○                            ○
       /|\        Chest facing      \|\
        |         downhill            |
       / \                           / \
      ╱   ╲                         ╱   ╲

Upper body stable,           Upper body rotating
facing down slope            with skis
```

### Key Points

- **Chest faces downhill** (or slightly toward outside of turn)
- **Shoulders level** with slope, not tilted
- **Hands forward** and visible
- **Hips may angulate** (tip into hill), but torso stays upright

## Common Parallel Turn Mistakes

### 1. Rotating Upper Body ❌

**Problem:** Whole body twists into turn
**Looks like:** Shoulders and chest turn with skis
**Fix:** Keep chest facing downhill, let legs work independently

### 2. Not Enough Weight on Outside Ski ❌

**Problem:** Skis skid, don't carve
**Feel:** Slipping sideways instead of arcing
**Fix:** Really commit to that outside ski (pick up inside ski slightly to test)

### 3. Too Much Weight on Inside Ski ❌

**Problem:** Inside ski catches, crossed tips
**Looks like:** Inside ski runs away
**Fix:** Lighten inside ski, could lift it briefly

### 4. Leaning Into the Hill (Banking) ❌

**Problem:** Whole body tips like a motorcycle
**Why bad:** Reduces edge grip, easy to wash out
**Fix:** **Angulate** - keep upper body upright while legs tip

```
BANKING (Wrong):           ANGULATION (Right):

      ╲ ○                        ○
       ╲|                       /|╲
        ╲                      / | ╲
         ╲                    /  |  ╲
          ╲                  ╱   |   ╲

Whole body tips            Upper body upright,
into turn                  legs angled under
```

### 5. Not Finishing Turns ❌

**Problem:** Speed builds, out of control
**Why:** Turning toward fall line but not completing across
**Fix:** Finish each turn going across or slightly uphill

## Parallel Turn Drills

### Drill 1: Javelin Turns

Lift your inside ski completely off the snow during turns. This FORCES you to balance on the outside ski.

```
Javelin Turn:

    ○
   /|\
    |                Inside ski lifted!
   / \
  /   \---------
 ╱
```

### Drill 2: 1000 Steps

Make very short turns by stepping your skis through the turn (like walking). This builds the feeling of independent leg movement.

### Drill 3: Railroad Tracks

Try to leave two clean lines in the snow (like railroad tracks), not a smeared fan shape. This indicates clean carving.

### Drill 4: Shuffle Turns

Keep feet moving, stepping weight from ski to ski through turns. Prevents getting stuck on one ski.

### Drill 5: Pole Drag

Drag the pole tip on the inside of your turn. This creates upper/lower body separation and proper body position.

### Drill 6: Hands on Hips

Ski with hands on hips. Forces you to use legs for turning, not arm swinging.

## Turn Shape Variations

### Long Radius (GS-style)

```
   ╭──────────────╮
   │              │
   │              │
   │              │
   ╰──────────────╯

- Big, sweeping arcs
- Higher speed
- Less edge angle
- Great for wide, open runs
```

### Short Radius (Slalom-style)

```
   ╭──╮
   │  │
   ╰──╯
   ╭──╮
   │  │
   ╰──╯

- Quick, tight turns
- Speed control
- More edge angle
- Great for steeper terrain
```

### Medium Radius

The standard. Most of your skiing will be here.

## Building Parallel Turn Consistency

### Progression

1. **Stem parallel** - Start with small stem, match immediately
2. **Parallel with traverse** - Make one turn, traverse, turn again
3. **Linked parallel** - Turn after turn without stopping
4. **Rhythmic parallel** - Smooth, connected, consistent timing

### Terrain Progression

| Stage | Terrain | Focus |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Learning | Easy green | Get the feeling |
| Building | Green/easy blue | Link turns |
| Refining | Blue | Speed control, consistency |
| Testing | Steeper blue | Confidence in the skill |

---

## Signs of Good Parallel Turns

✅ Both skis leave similar tracks in snow
✅ Smooth transition between turns
✅ No wedge at any point
✅ Controlled speed throughout
✅ Comfortable making turns in both directions
✅ Can vary turn radius at will
✅ Upper body stays stable

## Key Takeaway

> **Parallel skiing is about EDGES and WEIGHT, not about twisting or forcing.**

Let your skis do the work. Tip them on edge, weight the outside ski, and they will turn. The more you fight it, the harder it is.
