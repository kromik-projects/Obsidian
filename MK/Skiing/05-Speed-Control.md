# Speed Control - Managing Velocity with Confidence

Speed is not your enemy - uncontrolled speed is. Learn to manage your velocity and you'll ski with confidence on any terrain.

## The Golden Rule of Speed Control

> **You control speed with TURN SHAPE, not with wedging or braking.**

```
MORE ACROSS THE SLOPE = SLOWER

    Start                           Start
      │                               │
      ↓                               ↓
      │                                \
      │   Direct down                   \
      │   = FAST                         \   Across slope
      │   = Scary                          \  = SLOWER
      │                                      \ = Control
      ↓                                        →
```

## Four Methods of Speed Control

### 1. Turn Shape (Primary Method)

**How:** Complete your turns more across the fall line
**When:** Always - this should be your default

```
FAST TURNS:              CONTROLLED TURNS:

    │                        │
    ↓                        ↓
   /                        ╱
  /                        ╱
 /                        ╱
/                        →  Turn completes
                            across slope
│                         │
↓                         ↓
 \                         ╲
  \                         ╲
   \                         ╲
                              →

Short across-slope       Long across-slope
portion = speed builds   portion = speed bleeds
```

### 2. Turn Frequency (Secondary Method)

**How:** More turns = more friction = less speed
**When:** Steep terrain, need maximum control

```
FEW TURNS (Fast):        MANY TURNS (Slow):

   ╭───────────╮           ╭─╮
   │           │           │ │
   │           │           ╰─╯
   │           │           ╭─╮
   │           │           │ │
   ╰───────────╯           ╰─╯
                           ╭─╮
Same distance,             │ │
fewer turns =              ╰─╯
more speed
                          Same distance,
                          more turns =
                          less speed
```

### 3. Edge Angle (Fine-Tuning)

**How:** More edge = more grip = less skid = more control
**When:** Adjusting within a turn, carving vs skidding

### 4. Terrain Selection (Strategic)

**How:** Choose gentler lines down the slope
**When:** Terrain is too challenging for skill level

```
MOUNTAIN CROSS-SECTION:

      ╱╲
     ╱  ╲
    ╱    ╲
   ╱      ╲
  ╱   │    ╲
 ╱    │     ╲
╱     ▼      ╲

      A  B

Line A: Direct = steep
Line B: Diagonal = gentler
```

## Speed Control Technique: The Check

A "check" is a quick edge-set to scrub speed between turns.

### How to Check

1. Coming out of a turn, set edges firmly
2. Push against the snow briefly
3. Flex and extend to release
4. Begin next turn

```
Turn → CHECK → Turn

   ╭───╮
   │   │
   │   ╰──█──╮    █ = Check/edge set
   │         │
   ╰──█──╮   │
         │   │
         ╰───╯
```

### When to Use Checks

- Terrain is steeper than comfortable
- Building too much speed
- Need to look around (safety)
- Preparing for terrain change ahead

---

## The Speed Comfort Ladder

Build tolerance gradually:

```
COMFORT ZONE EXPANSION:

Week 1:    [███░░░░░░░] Green, slow
Week 3:    [█████░░░░░] Green, moderate
Week 6:    [███████░░░] Blue, moderate
Week 10:   [█████████░] Blue, faster
Week 15:   [██████████] Blue, confident

░ = Outside comfort zone
█ = Comfortable
```

### Rule: Stay 80% in Comfort

- 80% of runs = Comfortable speed/terrain
- 20% of runs = Slightly challenging
- 0% of runs = Terrifying

Fear teaches bad habits. Stay where you can practice good technique.

---

## Mental Techniques for Speed

### 1. Breathe

Holding breath = tense body = poor skiing
Exhale through turns = relaxed skiing

### 2. Look Ahead

Looking at ski tips = reactive = feel fast
Looking 2-3 turns ahead = proactive = feel controlled

### 3. Count Your Rhythm

"1-2-3-turn, 1-2-3-turn" creates rhythm and prevents freezing.

### 4. Pick Your Line

Plan where your next 3 turns will be. Having a plan feels controlled.

---

## Terrain-Specific Speed Control

### On Groomed Runs

- Turn shape is your friend
- Carving edges grip well
- Long turns for speed, short turns for control

### On Ice

- **Reduce edge angle** (less likely to slip out)
- **Lighter, quicker turns**
- Stay forward in stance
- Don't fight it - flow with available grip

### On Steep Terrain

- **Finish turns fully** (across the slope)
- Keep turns connected
- No straight running between turns
- Use checks if needed

### In Crud/Chopped Snow

- Medium turn radius
- More active leg movements
- Absorb variations with legs
- Moderate speed (not too slow!)

## Common Speed Control Mistakes

### 1. Sitting Back When Scared ❌

**Why it happens:** Fear → want to "brake"
**What happens:** Skis accelerate away, MORE out of control
**Fix:** Get forward! Commit to the turn.

### 2. Looking at the Steepest Part ❌

**Why:** Your eyes go to the scary thing
**What happens:** You ski toward it (you go where you look!)
**Fix:** Look where you want to go - across the slope

### 3. Not Finishing Turns ❌

**Why:** Want to hurry through the scary part
**What happens:** Speed builds each turn
**Fix:** Be patient, let each turn come across the slope

### 4. Going Stiff ❌

**Why:** Fear = tension
**What happens:** Legs can't absorb, catch edges, crash
**Fix:** Stay bouncy, move with the terrain

### 5. Making Pizza When Scared ❌

**Why:** Wedge feels like brakes
**What happens:** At higher speeds, wedge is unstable
**Fix:** Trust parallel turns - they're more stable at speed

## Building Speed Confidence

### Drill 1: Speed Runs on Easy Terrain

Go faster than comfortable on GREEN runs. This teaches that speed isn't inherently dangerous.

### Drill 2: Speed Control on Moderate Terrain

On BLUE runs, practice going slow, medium, fast - all by controlling turn shape, not braking.

### Drill 3: Countdown Stops

Pick a spot ahead. Count "5-4-3-2-1-stop" and stop exactly there. Builds confidence in your control.

### Drill 4: Emergency Stop Practice

From moderate speed, practice quick parallel stops (hockey stops). Know you CAN stop quickly.

### Drill 5: Follow Someone Faster

Ski behind a more skilled friend. Try to match their line and speed. Shows you what's possible.

## Signs You're Ready for Steeper Terrain

✅ Current terrain feels "too easy"
✅ You can stop anywhere on current terrain
✅ Speed doesn't make you panic
✅ You're making consistent, controlled turns
✅ You WANT to try harder terrain (not just proving something)

---

## Emergency Speed Situations

### If Going Too Fast

1. **Don't panic** - tensing makes it worse
2. **Turn across the slope** - commit to a full turn
3. **Sit into the turn** - dig edges in hard
4. **If needed, fall** - controlled fall is better than collision

### Falling Safely

If you must fall:
- Fall **uphill** (toward the slope)
- Fall on your **side/hip**, not forward
- Keep arms in (not outstretched)
- Slide to a stop

```
FALL TECHNIQUE:

Going too fast:          Fall uphill:
      │                     ╲
      │                      ╲  ●
      ↓                       ╲/
    ╱  ╲                       ╲
                              onto side
```

## Key Takeaway

> **Speed is controlled by where you go, not by how hard you brake.**

Finish your turns. Point your skis across the slope. The snow does the slowing for you.
