## Stance Mistakes

### 1. The Backseat

```
WRONG:                    RIGHT:
     ○                        ○
    /|\                      /|\
     | ╲                    / |
    /|  ╲                  /  |
   / |   ╲                    |
──●──●────              ──●──●──

Hips behind feet         Hips over feet
Weight on heels          Weight on balls of feet
```

**Why it happens:** Fear, or trying to "slow down"
**Symptoms:**
- Quads burn quickly
- Skis feel uncontrollable
- Hard to initiate turns
- Falls backward

**Fixes:**
1. Press shins into boot tongues constantly
2. Keep hands forward where you can see them
3. Practice on easier terrain
4. Tell yourself "nose over toes"

---

### 2. Stiff Legs

```
WRONG:                    RIGHT:
     ○                        ○
    /|\                      /|\
     |                      / |
     |                     /  |
     |                    ●   |
──●──●──                ──●───●──

Locked knees             Soft, bent knees
```

**Why it happens:** Tension, fatigue, focusing too hard
**Symptoms:**
- Harsh ride, every bump felt
- Can't absorb terrain
- Edges catch unexpectedly

**Fixes:**
1. Bounce gently while skiing
2. Think "marshmallow legs" - soft and squishy
3. Take a break if fatigued
4. Sing or hum to relax

---

### 3. Looking at Ski Tips

**Why it happens:** Wanting to see what skis are doing
**Symptoms:**
- Feeling unbalanced
- Not seeing obstacles or people
- Head down throws off stance

**Fixes:**
1. Pick a target 20m ahead, ski toward it
2. Have someone ski in front to follow
3. Trust your feet - you don't need to watch them
4. Practice on easy terrain with head deliberately up

---

### 4. T-Rex Arms

```
WRONG:                    RIGHT:
     ○                        ○
    /█\                      /█\
     █     Arms tucked       █
    / \    at sides         / \

                         ● ─┬─ ●
                            │     Hands forward
                           / \    and out
```

**Why it happens:** Cold, or not knowing what to do with arms
**Symptoms:**
- Poor balance
- Can't use poles effectively
- Shoulders tense up

**Fixes:**
1. Hold hands where you can see them in peripheral vision
2. Imagine holding a beach ball in front of you
3. "Boxer position" - fists up like guarding

---

## Turning Mistakes

### 5. Rotating Upper Body

```
WRONG:                    RIGHT:

    ←○                        ○
    ╱|╲                      /|╲
     |   Whole body         |
    / \  twists           / \

    Turn direction ←      Chest faces downhill
                          Legs turn underneath
```

**Why it happens:** Using whole body to "steer"
**Symptoms:**
- Off-balance
- Skis wash out
- Can't link turns smoothly

**Fixes:**
1. Keep chest facing downhill
2. Ski with hands on hips (forces leg-only turning)
3. Imagine torso is in a barrel, can't twist
4. Focus on knee steering, not body twisting

---

### 6. Inside Ski Dominance

**Problem:** Putting too much weight on inside ski of turn

```
TURNING LEFT:

WRONG:                    RIGHT:
    ○                        ○
   /|\                      /|\
    |                        |
   /█\                      / \
  █   \                    /   █

Weight on LEFT ski       Weight on RIGHT ski
(inside of turn)         (outside of turn)
```

**Why it happens:** Feels natural to lean into turn
**Symptoms:**
- Inside ski crosses or catches
- Turns feel weak
- Fall to inside of turn

**Fixes:**
1. Javelin drill - lift inside ski during turns
2. Really commit to outside ski
3. Think "step onto new outside ski" each turn

---

### 7. Not Finishing Turns

```
WRONG:                    RIGHT:

  ↓                         ↓
 /                         ╱
/                         ╱
│  Doesn't come          ╱
│  across slope     →   →   Completes across
│
↓                         ↓
 \                         ╲
  \                         ╲
```

**Why it happens:** Impatience, wanting to start next turn
**Symptoms:**
- Speed builds each turn
- Feeling out of control
- Exhausting runs

**Fixes:**
1. Count "1-2-3" in each turn, don't start next until 3
2. Focus on where turn ENDS, not where it starts
3. Practice on easy terrain, exaggerate finishing
4. Touch pole to snow at turn completion

---

### 8. Wedge at Speed

**Problem:** Using wedge on blue/black runs at higher speeds

**Why it's dangerous:**
- Wedge unstable at speed
- Tips can cross
- Blocks view of terrain ahead

**Fixes:**
1. If you need a wedge, the terrain is too hard
2. Build parallel turn confidence on easier terrain
3. Trust parallel stopping - it works better at speed

---

## Edge Mistakes

### 9. Banking Instead of Angulating

```
BANKING (Wrong):           ANGULATION (Right):

      ╲ ○                        ○
       ╲|                       /|
        ╲                      / |
         ╲                    /  |
          ╲                  ╱   ╲

Whole body leans          Upper body upright
into turn                 Legs angled under
```

**Why it happens:** Mimicking motorcycles or bicycles
**Symptoms:**
- Edges don't grip
- Skid/wash out on steeper terrain
- Fall to inside of turns

**Fixes:**
1. Keep belly button/chest facing downhill
2. Create "C" shape with body - bend at waist toward outside of turn
3. Drill: touch outside hand to outside boot during turns

---

### 10. Flat Skis Through Turn

**Problem:** Skis stay flat instead of tipping on edge

**Symptoms:**
- Skidding sound
- Snow sprays sideways
- Turn radius is hard to control

**Fixes:**
1. Roll ankles into turn
2. Point knees where you want to go
3. Think "tip the skis" not "turn the skis"
4. Practice on gentle slope: tip skis, see them carve

---

## Balance Mistakes

### 11. Weighting Uphill Ski on Traverse

```
Traversing left:

WRONG:                    RIGHT:
    ___                      ___
   /   ╲                    /   ╲
       │                    █
       █                    │
─────────────          ─────────────

Weight uphill           Weight downhill
(uncomfortable)         (stable)
```

**Why it happens:** Feels safer to lean toward slope
**Symptoms:**
- Uphill ski catches
- Feel like you're sliding toward edge
- Hard to start turns

**Fix:** Weight the downhill ski when traversing

---

### 12. Static Balance

**Problem:** Standing rigid instead of dynamic

**Why it happens:** Thinking skiing is about holding a position
**Reality:** Skiing is constant adjustment

**Symptoms:**
- Catching edges
- Can't handle variable terrain
- Tiring quickly

**Fixes:**
1. Keep moving - small adjustments constantly
2. Bounce gently, shuffle feet
3. Think "ready to jump" not "standing still"

---

## Mental Mistakes

### 13. Going Too Fast for Skill Level

**Signs you're doing this:**
- Feel terrified most of the run
- Can't make clean turns
- Have to wedge or skid to slow down
- Finish runs exhausted/shaking

**Fix:** Easier terrain! There's no shame in greens.

---

### 14. Death Grip on Poles

**Problem:** Squeezing poles tightly out of fear
**Effect:** Tenses shoulders, arms, whole body

**Fixes:**
1. Loose grip - poles should almost fall out
2. Or ski without poles temporarily
3. Shake out hands between runs

---

### 15. Competing with Others

**Problem:** Trying to keep up with better skiers on hard terrain
**Effect:** Fear, bad habits, injuries

**Fix:** Ski your own progression. It's not a race.

---

## Environment Mistakes

### 16. Wrong Ski Length/Type

**Signs:**
- Skis feel impossibly hard to turn
- Skis feel unstable at any speed
- Always fighting the equipment

**Fix:** Rent or demo different skis. Get advice from ski shop.

---

### 17. Poor Boot Fit

**Most common equipment problem!**

**Signs:**
- Foot pain
- Shin pain ("shin bang")
- Heel lifting
- No control over edges

**Fix:** Get boots professionally fitted. This is THE most important equipment.

---

## Quick Diagnostic

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Quads burning | Backseat | Get forward |
| Skis crossing | Inside ski weighted | Weight outside ski |
| Can't stop | Not finishing turns | Complete turns across slope |
| Catching edges | Stiff legs / wrong edge | Soften legs, proper edge |
| Falling backward | Backseat | Shins in boots, hands forward |
| Falling into turn | Banking | Angulate, upper body upright |
| Speed out of control | Not finishing turns | Full turn completion |
| Terrified | Too hard terrain | Go to easier runs |

## Key Takeaway

> **Most problems come back to THREE things: stance too far back, too stiff, or not enough weight on outside ski.**

Fix those, and 80% of problems disappear.
