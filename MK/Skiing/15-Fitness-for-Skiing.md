## The Four Pillars of Ski Fitness

### 1. Leg Strength
**Why:** Every turn loads your legs
**Key muscles:** Quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves

### 2. Core Stability
**Why:** Connects upper and lower body, maintains posture
**Key muscles:** Abs, obliques, lower back

### 3. Balance & Proprioception
**Why:** Constant small adjustments on uneven terrain
**Key areas:** Ankle stability, single-leg balance

### 4. Cardiovascular Endurance
**Why:** Altitude + exertion = need aerobic fitness
**Key focus:** Sustained moderate effort

### Intensity
- Mostly moderate (can hold conversation)
- 1-2 sessions/week with intervals

### Duration
- 30-60 minutes per session
- Build up gradually

## During the Ski Trip

### Morning Before Skiing
5-10 minute warm-up:
- Light jog/jumping jacks
- Leg swings
- Squats
- Hip circles

### Between Runs
- Shake out legs
- Stay moving (don't sit long)
- Hydrate

### Evening After Skiing
- Gentle stretching
- Foam rolling if available
- Hydration + protein

---

## Injury Prevention Focus

### Most Common Ski Injuries
1. **Knee (ACL)** - Build quad and hamstring strength
2. **Shoulder** - Don't reach out with arms during falls
3. **Thumb** - Don't grip poles when falling
4. **Head** - WEAR A HELMET

### Exercises for Knee Protection

**Quad dominance prevention:**
- Hamstring curls
- Glute bridges
- Single leg deadlifts

**Lateral stability:**
- Side lunges
- Clamshells
- Lateral band walks

---

## Altitude Considerations

If traveling to high altitude (8,000+ feet):

### Before Trip
- Build cardio fitness
- Arrive a day early if possible

### First Day
- Take it easy
- Lots of water
- Limit alcohol

### Ongoing
- Stay hydrated (more water than usual)
- Watch for altitude sickness signs:
  - Headache
  - Nausea
  - Dizziness
  - Stop and descend if severe

---

## Fitness Test

### Before Your Trip, Can You:

| Test | Target |
|------|--------|
| Wall sit | 90 seconds |
| Single leg balance (eyes closed) | 30 seconds |
| Bodyweight squats | 30 consecutive |
| Plank | 60 seconds |
| Walk up 3 flights of stairs | Not winded |

If you can do all of these, you're ready!

---

## Equipment for Home Training

**Essential:**
- Exercise mat
- Resistance bands

**Nice to have:**
- Foam roller
- Balance board
- Dumbbells/kettlebell
- Stability ball

**Gym helpful but not required**

---

## Key Takeaway

> **Strong legs + stable core + good cardio = more fun, fewer injuries, faster learning**

Start training 6 weeks before your trip. Even 4 weeks helps. Even 2 weeks is better than nothing!
