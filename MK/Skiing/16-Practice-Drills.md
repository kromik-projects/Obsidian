**Terrain:** Well-groomed blue

**How:**
1. Make turns aiming for two clean lines in the snow
2. Like railroad tracks - two parallel arcs
3. If you see a smeared fan shape, you're skidding

```
CARVING (Goal):          SKIDDING (Avoid):
   │  │                     ╱╲
   │  │                    ╱  ╲
