# Safety and Etiquette - Mountain Rules and Awareness

Staying safe and being courteous makes skiing enjoyable for everyone. Know the rules before you hit the slopes.

## The Skier's Responsibility Code

These rules are posted at every resort. Memorize them!

### 1. Always Stay in Control
You must be able to stop or avoid other people or objects.

### 2. People Ahead of You Have the Right of Way
It's YOUR responsibility to avoid them, not theirs to avoid you.

### 3. Don't Stop Where You Obstruct a Trail or Aren't Visible
If you stop, move to the side. Don't stop below a blind roll.

### 4. When Entering a Trail or Starting Downhill, Yield to Others
Look uphill before merging or starting.

### 5. Use Devices to Prevent Runaway Equipment
Use ski brakes and leashes as appropriate.

### 6. Observe All Posted Signs and Warnings
Closed trails are closed for a reason.

### 7. Keep Off Closed Trails and Ropes
Ducking ropes can get you banned or killed (avalanche terrain).

## Stopping Safely

### Where to Stop

✅ **DO:**
- To the side of the trail
- Where you're visible from above
- On flat spots or wider areas

❌ **DON'T:**
- In the middle of a run
- Below a blind roller or crest
- In narrow choke points
- At landing zones for jumps

```
GOOD STOPPING:              BAD STOPPING:

## Lift Safety

### Getting On

1. Have poles in one hand
2. Look over shoulder for chair
3. Sit down as chair arrives
4. Pull bar down once moving

### During the Ride

- Keep bar down
- No horseplay or rocking
- Keep skis pointed up
- Don't drop anything

### Getting Off

1. Raise bar before unload ramp
2. Keep ski tips up
3. Stand and glide forward
4. Move away from unload area quickly

### If You Fall Getting Off

- Move out of the way immediately
- The lift operator will slow/stop if needed
- Don't panic

---

## Collision Avoidance

### Predicting Others' Movements

Most people:
- Ski in predictable arcs
- Follow groomed paths
- Slow down at flat spots
- Speed up in steep sections

Watch for:
- Out-of-control skiers (wide stance, panicked look)
- Kids (unpredictable)
- People looking at phones/not paying attention
- Beginners on terrain they can't handle

### Passing Safely

```
SAFE PASSING:

      ● ← You (uphill)
     ╱
    ╱
   ╱
  ● ← Other skier
   ╲
    ╲ Wide margin
     ╲
      ●  ← You continue

Give LOTS of room. They might turn into your path.
```

## Falling Safely

### How to Fall

1. **Don't fight it** - If you're going down, commit
2. **Go to the side** - Fall sideways/uphill if possible
3. **Protect your head** - Tuck chin, cover with arms
4. **Keep limbs in** - Don't reach out
5. **Don't catch with hands** - Can break wrists
6. **Roll with it** - Absorb, don't resist

### After a Fall

1. **Stay put** - Let momentum stop
2. **Check yourself** - Anything hurt?
3. **Gather equipment** - Retrieve skis, poles
4. **Move to side** - Get out of traffic
5. **Signal if hurt** - Cross skis above you = need help

### Crossed Skis = Help Needed

If you see this, stop and help or alert ski patrol!

## Helping Others

### If You Witness an Accident

1. **Stop safely** (don't create another accident)
2. **Secure the scene** - Stand above, alert others
3. **Check the person** - Are they conscious? Hurt?
4. **Don't move them** unless immediate danger
5. **Call ski patrol** - Usually dialing 0 or going to lift
6. **Stay until help arrives** if possible

### What Ski Patrol Does
- Medical assessment
- Transport by sled
- Report accidents
- You may need to provide witness info

---

## Terrain Park Safety

### If Using Terrain Parks

1. **Start small** - Don't hit big jumps first
2. **Observe first** - Watch others, understand the feature
3. **One person at a time** - Wait for landing to be clear
4. **Call your drop** - Yell "dropping!" before starting
5. **Move quickly after landing** - Get out of the way

### Terrain Park Signals

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Arm up ☝️ | Going/dropping |
| Arms crossed ❌ | Clear the landing |
| Thumbs up 👍 | All clear |

---

## Weather Awareness

### Visibility

| Condition | Visibility | Action |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Clear | Excellent | Normal skiing |
| Light snow | Good | Slightly slower |
| Heavy snow | Reduced | Slow down, follow markers |
| Flat light | Poor depth perception | Ski cautiously, easier terrain |
| Fog | Very poor | Consider stopping |

### Wind

- Lift closures possible
- Increased cold (wind chill)
- Harder to balance
- Exposed terrain = more wind

### Temperature

- Below 0°F (-18°C): Frostbite risk
- Check extremities regularly
- Take warm-up breaks
- Watch for signs of hypothermia

---

## Frostbite & Hypothermia

### Frostbite Signs
- Numbness in fingers, toes, ears, nose
- Skin turns white or grayish-yellow
- Skin feels hard or waxy

**Action:** Get inside, warm gradually (not with hot water), seek medical help if severe.

### Hypothermia Signs
- Shivering (then stops when severe)
- Confusion, slurred speech
- Clumsiness
- Drowsiness

**Action:** Get inside immediately, remove wet clothing, warm gradually, seek medical help.

---

## Equipment Safety

### Pre-Season Check
- Bindings tested and adjusted by professional
- Edges sharp (no rust/nicks)
- Bases waxed
- Boots in good condition

### Runaway Skis

If a ski comes off:
1. **Yell "LOOSE SKI!"** loudly
2. Try to stop it if safe
3. It's YOUR responsibility to retrieve it

Brakes should prevent runaways, but check they work.

---

## Avalanche Awareness (Backcountry)

**Resort skiing is controlled for avalanches. BUT:**

- Don't duck ropes into closed terrain
- Backcountry requires special training
- Never ski out-of-bounds without avalanche education
- Beacon, shovel, probe = required for backcountry

**If you see avalanche warning signs:** Report to ski patrol.

---

## Common Courtesy

### Do:
- Yield to ski school groups
- Be patient with beginners
- Help people who fall
- Pick up dropped items
- Say "excuse me" when passing close
- Thank lift operators

### Don't:
- Spray people with snow
- Cut in lift lines
- Be rude to service workers
- Leave trash on mountain
- Hog space in lodges during peak time
- Blast music without headphones

---

## Emergency Contacts

Before your trip, know:
- Ski patrol number (usually on trail map)
- Location of first aid stations
- Mountain's emergency protocol
- Location of AEDs (automated external defibrillators)

---

## Pre-Run Safety Checklist

Before each run:
✅ Helmet on and buckled
✅ Goggles clean
✅ Bindings click properly
✅ Know the trail difficulty
✅ Know how to get back (read trail map)
✅ Phone charged (for emergency)

---

## Key Takeaways

> **The downhill person has the right of way. Always.**

> **If you can't stop before hitting someone/something, you're going too fast.**

> **Closed terrain is closed for a reason. Lives have been lost by ignoring signs.**

> **Skiing is a community. Look out for each other.**
