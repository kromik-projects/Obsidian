## Key Formulas & Calculations

### Price Calculations

**Oil-Indexed Price:**
```
P = Slope × JCC + Constant
Example: P = 0.145 × $80 + $0 = $11.60/MMBtu
```

**Energy Conversion (LNG to MMBtu):**
```
MMBtu = Tonnes × 48.7 (average; varies by composition)
Example: 70,000t × 48.7 = 3,409,000 MMBtu
```

**TTF to $/MMBtu:**
```
$/MMBtu = (€/MWh ÷ 3.412) × EUR/USD
Example: (€40 ÷ 3.412) × 1.10 = $12.90/MMBtu
```

### Arbitrage Calculations

**Geographic Net-Back:**
```
Net-Back = Destination Price - Shipping - Canal - Port Fees
Example: $16.00 - $1.80 - $0.25 - $0.10 = $13.85/MMBtu
```

**US LNG Export Margin:**
```
Margin = JKM - HH - Liquefaction - Shipping
Example: $14.00 - $3.50 - $2.50 - $1.80 = $6.20/MMBtu
```

### Risk Calculations

**Position Value:**
```
Value = Volume (MMBtu) × Price ($/MMBtu)
Example: 3,409,000 × $14 = $47.7 million
```

**1-Day VaR (Parametric):**
```
VaR = Position × Price × Daily Vol% × Z-score
Example: 3.4M × $14 × 3% × 1.65 = $2.36M (95% confidence)
```
