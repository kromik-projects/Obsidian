## Boil-Off Management

### BOG Fundamentals

**Causes:**
- Heat ingress through insulation
- Cargo movement/sloshing
- Ambient temperature differential

**Boil-Off Rates:**
| Vessel Type | BOG Rate |
|-------------|----------|
| Modern membrane | 0.08-0.10%/day |
| Standard membrane | 0.10-0.15%/day |
| Moss | 0.10-0.12%/day |
| Older vessels | 0.15-0.25%/day |

**Example Calculation:**
```
Cargo: 70,000 tonnes
BOG rate: 0.10%/day
Voyage: 20 days
BOG: 70,000 × 0.10% × 20 = 1,400 tonnes
Percentage of cargo: 2%
```

### BOG Utilization Options

**As Fuel:**
- Most common approach
- BOG burned in ship engines
- Reduces fuel oil consumption
- Balance: BOG vs. propulsion needs

**Reliquefaction:**
- Onboard reliquefaction plants
- Converts BOG back to LNG
- Preserves cargo value
- Higher capital cost, operational complexity

**Thermal Oxidizer:**
- Burn excess BOG
- Last resort option
- Wasteful but sometimes necessary

### Heel Requirements

**Definition:** LNG retained in tanks between voyages

**Purpose:**
- Keep tanks cold
- Avoid costly warm-up/cool-down
- Enable immediate reloading

**Typical Amounts:**
```
Heel requirement: 1,500-3,000 m³ per tank
Total: 5,000-10,000 m³ per vessel (~2,000-4,500 tonnes)
```

**Commercial Implications:**
- Heel ownership (buyer vs. seller)
- Heel valuation
- Cool-down voyages for warm vessels

- Growing LNG-specific market

**Example:**
```
Current spot rate: $100,000/day
Forward Q1 rate: $80,000/day
Position: Sell 90 days @ $80,000
Settlement: (Spot - $80,000) × 90 days

If spot averages $70,000:
Profit: ($80,000 - $70,000) × 90 = $900,000
```

## Logistics Optimization

### Voyage Planning

**Optimization Variables:**
- Speed (fuel consumption vs. time)
- Route selection (canals, weather)
- Bunker purchasing
- Port scheduling

**Speed-Fuel Relationship:**
```
Fuel consumption ∝ Speed³ (approximately)
Reduce speed 10%: Save ~27% fuel
Trade-off: Longer voyage time
```

### Fleet Positioning

**Portfolio Considerations:**
- Vessel positions vs. cargo requirements
- Ballast voyage minimization
- Regional deployment strategy
- Seasonal adjustments

**Triangulation:**
- Load cargo A → Deliver → Load cargo B (avoid ballast)
- Requires coordination and market access
- Significant cost savings potential

### Inventory Management

**Floating Storage:**
- Use vessels as storage during contango
- Cost: Opportunity cost of TC rate
- Benefit: Capture time spread

**Example:**
```
Current JKM: $10/MMBtu
3-month forward JKM: $14/MMBtu
Spread: $4/MMBtu

Storage cost:
Vessel: $80,000/day × 90 days = $7.2 million
BOG loss: 1,400 tonnes × $486 = $0.68 million
Total: $7.88 million

Cargo value: 70,000t × $4/MMBtu × 48.7 = $13.6 million gain
Net profit: $5.7 million
```
