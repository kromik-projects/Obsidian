Calculate the z-score for: a) x = 65, b) x = 35, c) x = 50

### Exercise 1.17
A stock has mean daily return = 0.05% and σ = 1.5%
Calculate the z-score for a return of -3.2%

### Exercise 1.18
Given μ = 0.08%, σ = 1.2%
Calculate z-scores for these returns:
a) +1.44%
b) -2.52%
c) +0.08%
d) -3.68%

### Exercise 1.19
Mean return = 0%, σ = 2%
What return corresponds to: a) z = +2, b) z = -3, c) z = +1.5?

### Exercise 1.20

- Daily σ: 1.8%
- Today's return: -4.5%

a) Calculate the z-score
b) Is this within 1σ, 2σ, 3σ, or beyond?

### Exercise 1.23
Complete the analysis:
